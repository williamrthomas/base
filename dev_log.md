# Development Log

## Session: 2024-03-20 - Initial Setup


**Session Goal:**
* Create a base project template with all necessary configuration files and documentation

**Work Completed:**
* Created manifesto.md with development principles and practices
* Created projectplan.md template for future projects
* Created clinetips.md with guidance for working with Cline
* Created librarynotes.md documenting standard libraries
* Created dev_log.md template for tracking progress
* Set up Python project structure:
  - requirements.txt with required dependencies
  - .gitignore for version control
  - config/config.yaml for LLM configuration
  - src/api/llm_client.py for LLM interaction
  - src/utils/helpers.py for utility functions
  - .env.example for environment variables
* Set up virtual environment and installed all dependencies
* Created and tested LLM client with OpenRouter API
* Verified all components are working properly

**Challenges Faced:**
* Had to add python-dotenv package which was initially missing from requirements.txt
* Successfully resolved the dependency issue and completed testing

**Decisions Made:**
* Used OpenRouter as the default LLM provider for flexibility in model selection
* Implemented requests-cache for efficient API usage
* Structured the project to support both direct LLM interaction and utility functions

**Suggested Next Steps:**
* Create example projects using this template
* Add more utility functions as needed
* Consider adding test templates
* Consider adding CI/CD configuration

**Open Questions:**
* Should we add more specific project templates (e.g., web app, CLI tool)?
* Should we include example prompts in the prompts directory?
